What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a hidden .git directory to store the changes. Git needs the repository to track
	commits.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?
	The staging area is a "holding place" until you have all the files included that you want to
	submit to one commit. It allows better control of the commits.
